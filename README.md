# LinkHub

LinkHub is a self-hosted link-in-bio app with an admin dashboard, short redirects, embeds, analytics, and a large visual customization system.

# ⚠ This project is not currently maintained! After updating some very solid features, I have decided to move all of my progress into my new venture, [PortalPage!](https://portalpage.app)

## PortalPage is my public access site to this project. Instead of deploying it yourself, you can create an account PortalPage. I realized that many people that need something like this, won't deploy it manually, spending money on a server host + domain.

### Although, it was a very fun hobby project to do. I love the idea of LinkHub, I love the idea of a free/cheaper alternative to these paid bio sites.

## Highlights

- Secure admin login with hashed passwords (`bcrypt`)
- Link management (ordering, visibility, icons, custom color)
- Featured spotlight link system (single featured link, optional pinned top placement, optional thumbnail)
- Redirect management (`/slug -> target URL`)
- Per-slug OpenGraph/Twitter metadata for redirects
- Custom embed blocks (strictly sanitized iframe HTML)
- Per-link and per-redirect analytics (clicks, CTR, referrers, device, geo, hour, UTM)
- QR code generator in admin (profile, links, blocks, redirects)
- Auto link enrichment in admin (URL -> suggested title, icon, preview image)
- Asset manager with reusable media library (images/videos), alt text metadata, and in-form picker buttons
- Theme template gallery with one-click presets and JSON import/export
- Scheduling and targeting rules for links/blocks (time windows + request-based rules)
- Visit and like counters
- Open Graph / social share metadata editor
- Private content controls (password gates, 18+ verification, spoiler reveal)
- CSP + Helmet hardening, rate limiting, and CSRF checks
- Abuse controls for production traffic (redirect rate limits + view-count dedupe window)
- CI workflow with syntax checks and tests

## Tech Stack

- Node.js + Express
- EJS templates
- MySQL / MariaDB
- Session storage in MySQL

## Project Structure

```text
public/                  Static assets (css, js, images, uploads)
views/                   EJS templates
scripts/                 Dev startup scripts
test/                    Node test suite

.env.development.example Local development environment template
```

## Local Development (Fast Visual Preview)

This includes fake/demo data so the UI is populated immediately.

### 1) Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2) Create your development env file

```bash
cp .env.development.example .env.development
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.development.example .env.development
```

### 3) Start local MySQL (Docker)

```bash
npm run dev:db:up
```

### 4) Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

- App: `http://localhost:3000`
- Admin: `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
- Default dev admin (from `.env.development.example`):
  - username: `admin`
  - password: `admin12345`

To stop local DB:

```bash
npm run dev:db:down
```

### Troubleshooting: `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3307`

This means the app cannot reach your MySQL dev DB.

For Docker-based dev DB:

1. Start Docker Desktop.
2. Run:

```bash
npm run dev:db:up
```

3. Then start app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Quick port check in PowerShell:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 127.0.0.1 -Port 3307
```

If you use a local MySQL install instead of Docker, update `.env.development` with the correct `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` and ensure MySQL is running.

## Production Setup

### 1) Create environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set strong values for:

- `SESSION_SECRET`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `DB_*`
- `PUBLIC_DOMAIN`

### 2) Run

```bash
npm start
```

## Security Notes

- Only `http/https` URLs are accepted for links and redirects.
- File uploads are restricted by field:
  - Avatar / OG: PNG, JPG, WEBP, GIF
  - Background media: PNG, JPG, WEBP, GIF, MP4, WEBM, OGG
  - Asset library: PNG, JPG, WEBP, GIF, MP4, WEBM, OGG
- Rich text is sanitized before storage.
- Embeds are hardened with strict server-side sanitization:
  - Only `iframe` embeds are allowed
  - Only `https` iframe sources are allowed
  - Iframe hostnames are restricted to an allowlist:
    - `youtube.com`, `youtube-nocookie.com`, `player.twitch.tv`, `tiktok.com`, `open.spotify.com`
  - Iframe `allow` permissions are filtered to a safe subset
  - Legacy/stored embed HTML is sanitized again before render (defense in depth)
- Session-backed CSRF token is required on admin writes.
- `TRUST_PROXY` should match your deployment topology.
- Click analytics stores hashed IP (`sha256` with session-secret salt) for unique counts, not raw IPs.
- Redirect traffic is rate-limited (`REDIRECT_RATE_LIMIT_*`) to reduce bot abuse.
- Likes endpoint is throttled (`LIKE_RATE_LIMIT_*`) to reduce spam clicks.
- Profile visit counting is deduped per visitor hash over a configurable window (`VIEW_COUNT_THROTTLE_SECONDS`) with retention cleanup (`VIEW_COUNT_RETENTION_DAYS`).
- Access passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes (never plaintext), with minimum length enforcement.
- Asset deletion is blocked while that asset is still referenced by settings, links, blocks, or redirects.
- Age verification is intentionally short-lived and route-scoped (refresh requires re-verification, per current UX).

## Quality Checks

```bash
npm run check
npm test
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs install + check + test on push/PR.
